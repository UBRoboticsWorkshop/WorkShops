## 3. Introduction
The MX1508 utilizes an H-bridge circuit design and employs high-reliability power MOSFET technology, making it especially suitable for driving coils, motors, and other inductive loads. The internal circuitry integrates N-channel and P-channel power MOSFETs, with an operating voltage range spanning from 2V to 8V. At 27°C with VDD at 6.5V, when both channels are active, the 2nd channel can provide a maximum continuous output current of 0.8A and a maximum peak output current of 1.5A. The 1st channel can provide a maximum continuous output current of 1.5A and a maximum peak output current of 2.5A. Don't worry which way around you connect the motor and the inputs- you can just reverse the motor in code.

## 4. Logical Truth Table
| INAx | INBx | OUTAx | OUTBx | Function  |
|------|------|-------|-------|-----------|
|   L  |   L  |   Z   |   Z   |  Idle     |
|   H  |   L  |   H   |   L   | Forward   |
|   L  |   H  |   L   |   H   | Backward  |
|   H  |   H  |   L   |   L   | Brake     |

H denotes high voltage, L low voltage and Z means floating- not connected to either
- Idle Mode
In idle mode, INAx=INBx=L. This includes all internal circuits, including driving power MOSFETs, being in a turned-off state. The circuit consumes very low current. At this time, the motor output terminals OUTAx and OUTBx are both in a high impedance state.

- Forward Mode
Forward mode is defined as: INAx=H, INBx=L. In this mode, the motor drive terminal OUTAx outputs a high level, and the motor drive terminal OUTBx outputs a low level. In this state, the motor drive current flows from OUTAx into the motor and from OUTBx to the ground terminal, defining the motor's rotation as forward mode.

- Reverse Mode
Reverse mode is defined as: INAx=L, INBx=H. In this mode, the motor drive terminal OUTBx outputs a high level, and the motor drive terminal OUTAx outputs a low level. In this state, the motor drive current flows from OUTBx into the motor and from OUTAx to the ground terminal, defining the motor's rotation as reverse mode.

- Brake Mode
Brake mode is defined as: INAx=H, INBx=H. This will short the motor's terminals together.

## 5. Code
```cpp
#include <Arduino.h>

const int inA1Pin = 13; // Connect to A1 on MX1508
const int inA2Pin = 12; // Connect to A2 on MX1508

uint8_t mode;
uint8_t pulseWidth = 0;
unsigned long lastInterruptTime = 0;
```
>Create constants and global variables- a global variable can be accessed anywhere in the code, which is sometimes useful but can also cause confusing problems and use excessinve memory. However, in a simnple sketch like this it's fine.

```cpp
void IRAM_ATTR handleInterrupt() {
  // This function will be called when the falling edge of GPIO 0 is detected.

  // Record the current time
  unsigned long currentMillis = millis();

  // Check if the interrupt occurred after a debounce delay
  if (currentMillis - lastInterruptTime >= 100) {
    pulseWidth = 0;
    mode ++;
    Serial.print("Mode: "); Serial.println(mode);
  }

  // Update the last interrupt time
  lastInterruptTime = currentMillis;
}
```
>This is an interrupt- when a certain condition is met, in this case when the switch pin goes from 5 volts to zero, the ESP32 pauses the main code to run this code. Once this code is complete, it picks back up where it left off. It's really important that this code is as fast as possible, so no complex functions or delays. The tag IRAM_ATTR means this code is in internal RAM- the ESP32 has two main places to store code, internal RAM within the actual microcontroller and SPI RAM in a seperate IC chip outside it. The SPI RAM requires communication between the chips, and is quite slow. If the code gets moved to SPI RAM it will make the interrupt very slow, causing the code to suddenly stop working- the IRAM_ATTR tag stops this from happening.

>There is also the issue of debouncing- when a switch is pressed, the contacts don't close smoothly. Before they fully close, they bounce back and forth many times causing a series of pulses. This means that when selecting a mode, the mode will more or less change to a random mode as the interrupt runs ten or twenty times making the system unusable. To prevent this, we simply check when the last pulse was and ignore it if it's too close to the last one.

```cpp
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);

  pinMode(inA1Pin, OUTPUT);
  ledcSetup(0, 500, 8);  // Configure PWM channel 0, 500 Hz, 8-bit resolution
  ledcAttachPin(inA1Pin, 0);  // Attach the PWM channel to the GPIO pin

  pinMode(inA2Pin, OUTPUT);
  ledcSetup(1, 500, 8);
  ledcAttachPin(inA2Pin, 1);

  pinMode(0, INPUT_PULLUP); // Mode selection button connected to GPIO 0
  attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(0), handleInterrupt, FALLING);
}
```
 >Here, we set up serial as before, then set up PWM for both motor control pins. Finally, we attach the interrupt as a falling interrupt to pin zero (the boot button on the ESP32).

```cpp
void loop() {
  switch (mode): {
    case 0: { // IDLE
      ledcWrite(0, 0);
      ledcWrite(1, 0);

      break;
    }
    case 1: { // Forward 
      ledcWrite(0, pulseWidth++);
      ledcWrite(1, 0);

      break;
    }

    case 2: { // Backward 
      ledcWrite(1, pulseWidth++);
      ledcWrite(0, 0);

      break;
    }

    case 3: { // Brake
      ledcWrite(1, 255);
      ledcWrite(0, 255);

      break;
    }

    default: {
      mode = 0;

      break;
    }
  }

  delay(20);
}
```
>Here we use a "case select"- the value of "mode" will be taken, then the case that matches it will execute. If mode doesn't match any case, the code underneath "default" will run.
>Setting the value in ledcWrite to 255, the maximum duty, makes the pin go to a constant 3.3v. If both pins are at 3.3v, the motor will engage in braking.
